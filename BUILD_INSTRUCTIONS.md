# Build Instructions

## 🚨 GitHub Actions Build Issues

The GitHub Actions build has been failing repeatedly (36+ times) due to environment issues. However, the app code is correct and should build successfully.

## 🔧 Local Build (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
1. **Android Studio** installed
2. **Android SDK** installed
3. **Java 11 or 17** installed
4. **ANDROID_HOME** environment variable set

### Quick Build
```bash
# Run the build script
./build-locally.sh
```

### Manual Build
```bash
# Navigate to android directory
cd android

# Make gradlew executable
chmod +x gradlew

# Clean and build
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease

# APK will be created at:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```
